# Mood-Based Song Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a song recommendation system using reinforcement learning techniques. The system recommends songs based on the user's mood and learns from user feedback to improve its recommendations over time. The dataset consists of Tamil songs categorized by different moods.

## Features
- **Mood-Based Recommendations**: Users can request song recommendations based on specific moods (e.g., happy, romantic, melancholic, sad, motivational).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The system uses Q-learning to update song recommendations based on user feedback.
- **User Interaction**: Users provide ratings (1-5) for the recommended songs, which the system uses to learn and adjust its recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Dataset
The dataset includes a list of Tamil songs along with their associated moods. Here is a sample of the dataset:

| Song Title                       | Mood        |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Aaruyire                         | happy       |
| Ennavale Adi Ennavale           | romantic    |
| Vennilave Vennilave             | melancholic |
| Unnai Kandu Naan                | sad         |
| Yaaro Ivan Yaaro                 | happy       |
| Mannavan Vanthanadi             | happy       |
| Azhagiya Tamil Magan            | romantic    |
| Pudhu Vellai Mazhai             | happy       |
| Thamarai Poovukkum              | sad         |
| Suttrum Vizhi                   | melancholic |
| ...                              | ...         |
| Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal           | motivational |

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd mood-based-song-recommendation
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```

## Usage
1. Open a Python environment and run the script:
   ```bash
   python rl.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to get song recommendations based on your mood. After each recommendation, rate the song on a scale of 1 to 5.

3. The system will update its recommendations based on your feedback.

## Example Interaction
```
Recommended Song for mood 'happy': Aaruyire
Rate the song (1-5): 5
Recommended Song for mood 'romantic': Ennavale Adi Ennavale
Rate the song (1-5): 4
```

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset to include more songs and moods.
- Implement a user interface for better user experience.
- Explore advanced reinforcement learning techniques for improved recommendations.
